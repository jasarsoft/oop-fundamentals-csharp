## Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals in C#
### by Deborah Kurata

This course takes you through the principles and practices of object-oriented programming (OOP). The course provides you with the firm foundation in OOP that you need to progress to intermediate-level C# courses. It begins by showing you how to turn a set of words into a set of well-defined and related classes. Through demonstrations, it teaches you key object-oriented concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.
